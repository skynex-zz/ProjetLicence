  abstract = {A Web Service (WS) is a type of component specifically conceived for
                  distributed machine-to-machine interaction. Interoperability between
                  WSs involves both data and messages exchanged and protocols of
                  usage, and is pursued via the establishment of standard
                  specifications to which service providers must conform. In previous
                  work we have envisaged a framework for WS testing. Within this
                  framework, this paper focuses on how the intended protocol of access
                  for a standard service could be specified, and especially on how the
                  conformance of a service instance to this specified protocol can
                  then be tested. We propose to augment the WSDL description with a
                  UML2.0 Protocol State Machine (PSM) diagram. The PSM is intended to
                  express how, and under which conditions, the service provided by a
                  component through its ports and interfaces can be accessed by a
                  client. We then propose to translate the PSM to a Symbolic
                  Transition System, to which existing formal testing theory and tools
                  can be readily applied for conformance evaluation. A simple example
                  illustrates the approach and highlights the peculiar challenges
                  raised by WS conformance testing.}

  abstract = {Classical state-oriented testing approaches are based on simple machine
  models such as Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs), in which data is
  represented by concrete values. To implement these theories,
  data types which have infinite universes have to be cut
  down to finite variants, which are subsequently enumerated to fit in the
  model. This leads to an explosion of the state space.
  Moreover, exploiting the syntactical and/or
  semantical information of the involved data types is non-trivial
  after enumeration. To overcome these problems, we lift the family of testing relations
  ioco to the level of Symbolic Transition Systems (STSs).
  We present an algorithm based on STSs, which generates and executes
  tests on-the-fly on a given system. It is sound and complete for the
  ioco testing relations.}

Yet, testing turns out to be expensive, laborious, time-consuming and error-prone. The Dutch research and development project C\^ote de Resyste worked on methods, techniques and tools for automating specification based testing using formal methods. The main achievement of the project is a test tool, baptized TorX, which integrates automatic test generation, test execution, and test analysis in an on-the-fly manner. On the one hand, TorX is based on well-defined theory, viz. the ioco-test theory, which has its roots in the theory of testing- and refusal-equivalences for transition systems. On the other hand, the applicability of TorX has been demonstrated by testing several academic and industrial case studies. This paper summarizes the main results of the project C\^ote de Resyste.},
